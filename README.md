# scala_crawl

scala project to create a large data webcrawl for financial data

# Scala functional programming

# Parallel Processing with Futures
The bottleneck of preforming the webcrawl is the accessing and scrapping of the webpage. As this is based on a separate links for the different pages this operation is parallizeable. I used future class for preforming the paralization.
